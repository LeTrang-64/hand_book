She put flowers on the grave, prayed, sang cosplas and drank wine until she was full. And she cried again and went home. Nobody can live this way, floating on a sea of sadness. So one day, the widow cried the last tear, closed her eyes and never waked up again. That is She never waked up in ...... Instead, She went to the land of the dead and she was happy. Now she could meet her husband again. She ran through the street of the land of the dead, climbed hills, mountains and asked every one where her husband was. But she could not find him. She looked everywhere, asked everyone. But still nothing. Her happiness turned to sadness. And she had no more tears to cry. Finally, she returned to the land of the living. Most people who die had no reason to the land of the living. But this woman would not feel in death until she found her husband again. So she walked to the road from the death to life. But of course the dead can not comeback to life so she returned as a ghost. her skin turned white like the flowers on her husband's grave. She floated through the air like petals in the wind. When she came to grave, she did everything like before. She try to put flowers on it, but she could not pick them up. She prayed but nobody hear her. She sang cosplas but her voice was not beautiful. She try to drink wine but wine went through her body. Most ghosts float from one place to another carrying sadness and old memories.
