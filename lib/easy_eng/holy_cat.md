the holy cat
one there was a cat who live in a town, the cat is good at hunting mice. The mice in the town was slow so he can catch easily. The cat hunt all the mice in the town.
the cat has an ideal , he left fow a few week and waited. he closes his eyes qnd start purring. and quickly went back into a hole. 
Why do you run away? I'm your old neighbor who come back from holy travel, but you do not say hello.
You run away when you see me. Do not be afraid. Come and talk and pray with me.
The mouse was very surprise, it stayed in a hole, but it spoke to the cat.
Why should i come and talk with you, do cat not hunt mice. if i come and pray with you, you will eat me just like you ate my brother and sister.
what you say is true i have sin every time. 

what you say is true. I'm truly sorry. I do not hunt now i spent my time to read holy book.
I have studied , the mouse surprise , who learn the quuan by heart call Haffi.so this cat call haffi and hachi.
tell them im sorry for my sin. tell them i want to speak and pray with them.
the mouse want and told his family who was also very surprise, each of them when and looked out of the hole.
and saw the cat with his prayer beads purring in a holy way. The mice all talked and decided to test the cat's holiness.
they sent one mouse out to test the cat. The mouse came out from a hole but stay far away from the cat. The mouse stay outside a long time to test the cat.
But realy, the cat was waiting for other mice to come out, he realy wanted to eat lots of them. he sit purring and still there was only one mouse there to test him.
He got hungrier and hungrier, finally he could not wait. The cat move to eat the mouse but the mouse was ready.
When the cat move, the mouse quickly run into the hole. Why are you running away, i wnat to give you a friendly hug. You have tested my holiness, did i not pray all day.
Have I not learned the Quan by heart.

A sinner can pray all day, but if he sin afterward it does not master.
and you may have learned the Quyan by heart but you have not unlearn hunting mice.
The cat move so quickly that his prayer beads fell off but he did not catch the mouse.
the cat return to the town but the was no more mice there so every day the cat purr nicely and ask for food form people.
Sometime he try to hunt in the fields, but he never caught another mouse
